# Countdown Numbers Game Solver

A TypeScript solver for the Countdown numbers game.

## The Game

In the Countdown numbers game, you are given six integers and a target number. Using basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), combine the six numbers to reach the target. Each number can only be used once, and all intermediate results must be positive integers.

```

### Code Quality

```bash
pnpm run type-check    # Check TypeScript types
pnpm run lint          # Run ESLint
pnpm run format        # Format code with Prettier
